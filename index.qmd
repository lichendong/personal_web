# About Me


I am a clinical psychology PhD student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison working in Dr. James Li’s Social and Behavioral Development Lab. My research lies at the intersection of **behavioral genetics** and **clinical science**. By integrating quantitative genetic and genomic methodologies, I hope to better understand the complex **interplay** of **genetic** and **environmental** influences on the **developmental origins** of **externalizing** and **neurodevelopmental** psychopathology. A second line of my research concerns the application of genomic technologies and prediction algorithms in clinical settings. I am also generally interested in quantitative methods, including structural euqation modeling, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning.
