A positive mentoring relationship fosters not only professional success of the mentee, but also their growth across many domains, including but not limited to confidence, initiative, perseverance, courage, and resilience. My mentorship aims to help students develop into young independent researchers who bring innovation and self-representation to the field.\nFor a positive mentoring relationship, I abide to several principles. First, I provide unconditional positive regard, because growth does not take place without self-faith and belongingness, to which unconditional positive regard is the key. Next, I foster an open and safe environment, since problems cannot be solved and progress cannot be made if the expression of feelings or thoughts is withheld. Lastly, I ensure that my mentorship unbiasedly serves the mentee, not the mentor: the purpose of mentoring is to scaffold the development of an independent person, and not to benefit or extend myself.\n\n\n\n\nPersonalize mentorship to specific mentee.\nEmphasize the mentee’s strengths not weaknesses.\nGuide the mentee in exploring academic interests.\nEstablish the mentee’s confidence and self-efficacy.\nFoster the mentee’s research related skills.\nHelp the mentee in developing independence."

My research lies at the intersection of behavioral genetics and clinical science. By integrating quantitative genetic and genomic methodologies, I hope to better understand the complex interplay of genetic and environmental influences on the developmental origins of externalizing and neurodevelopmental psychopathology. A second line of my research concerns the application of genomic technologies and prediction algorithms in clinical settings. I am also generally interested in quantitative methods, including structural euqation modeling, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning."
